## 🔑 Wallet Information

**Deployer Address:** `0x40D85e646AfE73eC45981f69273625f7C769E494`
**Private Key:** `0x63e160f95732463528c02e50b86cc5a48577cb9b4c67764eb249136866c3e1fd`

**Current Balance:**
- BNB: 0.3 BNB (plenty for testing)
- USDT: Need to get from faucet

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start Facilitator

```bash
cd b402-facilitator
npm start
```

Facilitator runs on: http://localhost:3402

### 2. Get Testnet USDT

**Faucet:** https://testnet.binance.vision/faucet-smart
**Your Address:** `0x40D85e646AfE73eC45981f69273625f7C769E494`

Or swap BNB → USDT on PancakeSwap testnet.

### 3. Run End-to-End Test

```bash
npx tsx test-b402-testnet.ts
```

This will:
1. ✅ Check USDT balance
2. ✅ Approve USDT to B402Relayer (one-time)
3. ✅ Sign payment authorization (0 gas!)
4. ✅ Verify signature with facilitator
5. ✅ Settle payment on BSC testnet
6. ✅ Show transaction on BSCScan

## 🎬 Livestream Demo Script

### Part 1: Show Deployed Contract (2 min)

Open BSCScan:
```
https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xd67eF16fa445101Ef1e1c6A9FB9F3014f1d60DE6
```

Show:
- ✅ Contract deployed successfully
- ✅ Code is there (can verify later)
- ✅ Ready to accept payments

### Part 2: Show Facilitator Running (1 min)

```bash
curl http://localhost:3402/health
```

Show JSON response with "healthy" status.

### Part 3: Run Live Test (5 min)

```bash
npx tsx test-b402-testnet.ts
```

Narrate what's happening:
1. "Checking USDT balance..."
2. "Approving USDT - this is one-time"
3. "Now signing payment - notice: 0 gas!"
4. "Facilitator verifying signature..."
5. "Settling payment on-chain..."
6. "DONE! Click the BSCScan link"

### Part 4: Show Transaction on BSCScan (2 min)

Open the transaction link from test output.

Show:
- ✅ Transaction successful
- ✅ 1 USDT transferred
- ✅ Gas paid by facilitator, not user
- ✅ All happened automatically

### Part 5: Explain What This Enables (3 min)

**Say:**
> "This is b402 - x402 for BNB Chain. Creators sign once, agents get paid automatically. No more asking users to approve 2 transactions. No more high gas fees. This is the future of agent payments on BSC."

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before livestream, verify:

- [ ] Facilitator running: `curl http://localhost:3402/health`
- [ ] Have testnet USDT in wallet
- [ ] Test script works: `npx tsx test-b402-testnet.ts`
- [ ] BSCScan links load correctly
- [ ] Transactions confirm in ~3 seconds

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No USDT found"
**Solution:** Get from faucet: https://testnet.binance.vision/faucet-smart

### "Facilitator not responding"
**Solution:**
```bash
cd b402-facilitator
npm start
```

### "Transfer failed"
**Solution:** Make sure you approved USDT first:
```typescript
await usdt.approve(B402_RELAYER, parseUnits('1000', 18));
```

### "Transaction reverts"
**Solution:** Check you have enough BNB for gas (~0.001 BNB per tx)

| Approve USDT | ~50,000 | 0.000005 | ~$0.005 |
| Sign Authorization | 0 | 0 | **FREE** |

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Production (BSC Mainnet):

1. **Deploy to mainnet:**
   ```bash
   ./DEPLOY_BSC_MAINNET.sh
   ```

2. **Host facilitator:**
   - Deploy to Railway/Render/Fly.io
   - Domain: api.b402.ai
   - Add monitoring

3. **Update SDK:**
   ```bash
   cd packages/b402-sdk
   npm publish --access public
   ```

4. **Integrate with Arena CLI:**
   - Add `arena bounty:create:b402`
   - Add `arena bounty:settle`
   - Update config with mainnet addresses
